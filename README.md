# Flutter Implicit Animation Demo

This Flutter project demonstrates the use of **implicit animations** with the `AnimatedContainer` widget. It shows how smooth transitions can improve user experience by visually responding to interactions.

---

##  Overview

**Implicit animations** allow you to create smooth transitions between changes in widget properties without manually controlling animation logic or using animation controllers.

Flutter’s built-in animation widgets, like `AnimatedContainer`, automatically animate changes in size, color, or position when properties are updated inside a `setState()` call.

---

##  Real-World Use Case

This type of animation is ideal when giving users **visual feedback**—such as resizing a button when clicked or highlighting content changes.  
In this demo, a container changes its **size and color** when tapped, simulating a **loading effect** or **user response feedback**.
